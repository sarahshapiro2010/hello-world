I am currently a classroom teacher but looking to transition into a new role outside of the classroom but still in the field of education.

I believe that my talents, abilities, and knowledge would be an asset and my varied employment and comprehensive education make me an excellent fit in the startup culture. My experience as a teacher has prepared me to be patient, courteous, and professional when working with many different types of people in a variety of professional and social situations. It was also a proving ground for my ability develop programs and projects and see them through to completion, as well as to adapt to an ever changing work environment. My time as a tutor, both for a company and self-employed, strengthened my ability to work independently, required that I balance many tasks simultaneously, and pushed me to manage my time efficiently. As a former graduate student TA, I am familiar with the workings of large universities and how to navigate successfully within the policies and procedures of a school.

I hope you find this Take Home Test to your complete satisfaction.
